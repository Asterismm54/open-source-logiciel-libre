# Open Source Standards

This document is Treasury Board of Canada Secretariatâ€™s **draft** standards to support the implementation of Treasury Board policy requirements related to open source use, contribution and publication.

The Government of Canada (GC) has been using Open Source Software (OSS) as part of its technology ecosystem for years, and is increasingly relying on it for successful service delivery.
As part of the commitment to become a digital government, GC will endeavour to contribute OSS back to external projects, as well as release its own source code under Open Source Software licences.
It is committed to doing so in a manner that is compatible with principles of transparency, accountability, and procedural fairness, and within the structures of existing policy and law.
