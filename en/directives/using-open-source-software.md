# Directive on using open source software (Draft)

## Authorities

This directive is issued under the authority of section 7 of the [Financial Administration Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-11/) and pursuant to sections 3 and 6.4.9 of the [Policy on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=12755).

## Objectives and expected results

The objective of this directive is to maximize the use of open source software as key components of its technology ecosystem to improve interoperability between systems, seek independence from software, technologies and vendors as well as substitutability of solutions and service providers.

### The expected results of this directive are as follows

* Enable greater flexibility in the management of information and communication technologies (ICT). (Too vague, need quantifiable results)
* Increased use of open source software by departments and agencies. (syntax)
* Support and increase collaboration between departments, agencies and other public administrations in Canada and around the world, including society as a whole.
* Canadians are able to reuse and contribute to open source software used by the GC to support meaningful engagement with their government and communities.
* Improve the overall availability of re-usable technology within government and society.

## Requirements

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) of departments and agencies, or any other person named by the CIO, is responsible for the following:

* Requiring that open source software be actively and fairly considered for all new technologies, upgrades or migrations (including cloud solutions).
* Selecting open source software on the basis of its additional inherent flexibility, when there is no significant overall (full-lifecycle) cost (TCO) difference with closed-source solutions.
* Ensuring that the use of open source software is compliant with its licence terms and conditions.
* Sharing the results of the security assessment of open source software with the Government as a whole.

* Factoring in exit or transition costs when calculating total cost of ownership (TCO) of solutions.
* Ensuring that an assessment process is in place to evaluate Open Source Software security. (Duplication of existing policy? Need to confirm with Cyber)
* Ensuring that a process is in place to update Open Source Software known security vulnerabilities. (A bit different than with a single vendor releasing patches)
* Ensuring that the relevant employees are sufficiently trained in the assessment, design, function, use and implementation of open source software.
* Ensuring that the relevant employees have access to the tools and services required to use, assess, deploy and maintain Open Source Software in compliance with this Directive.

* Ensuring that the open source software requirements of this directive are integrated in any new plans for procuring, developing, or modernizing departmental information applications, systems, or solutions in support of the delivery of programs and services.
