# GC Requirements for Source Code contribution (DRAFT)

## Questions to be clarified

* What current laws or policies supports/hinders/needs clarification to contribute open source code?
* Any law or policy regarding the source code being administrative documents that are communicable and reusable?

## Objectives

* Set the rules and principles for opening source code.
* Publish as open source all source code created or modified, whether developed internally by government employees or through negotiated contracts on behalf of the government.
* Support and be an active contributor (code, issues, testing, roadmap, ..) to OSS used by the GC and/or where there is benefit to Canadians
* Encourage contributions to OSS released by the GC, whether it be code, commentary, bug reports, feature requests, or overall strategic direction

## Expected results

* Benefit from other developers and communities collaborating on the software, including those outside of government
* Improving the overall availability of re-usable technology in society and within government.
* Help ensure the viability and perreniality of a project into the future.
* Support an Open Government - Open by default approach.
* Support and increase collaboration with other public administrations in Canada and around the world.

## Scope

> The following section is adapted from France's policy on [Open Source Contribution Policy Scope](https://github.com/DISIC/politique-de-contribution-open-source/blob/master/introduction.en.md#scope)
======>

Source code covered by this policy instrument are the ones:

* developed internally by the administration; this includes
* developed on behalf of the administration.

This contribution policy aims at new developments. For the opening of existing source code, additional actions will be needed, such as defining the scope, reviewing quality and security, and ensuring compliance specifically on intellectual property.

> <=======

> The following section is adapted from United States' [Federal Source Code Policy definition of Custom-developed code](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/source-code-policy/blob/gh-pages/pages/Appendixa.md)
======>

Source code may include, but are not limited to, code written for software projects, modules, plugins, scripts, middleware, and APIs; it does not, however, include code that is truly exploratory or disposable in nature, such as that written by a developer experimenting with a new language or library.
