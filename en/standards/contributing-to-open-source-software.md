**Managers, functional specialists, and equivalents responsible for enterprise architecure and software procurement and development are responsible for**

## See Appendix A - Don't Fork Open Source Software

Where possible, use open source software without modification.
See [Standard for Using Open Source Software](using-open-source-software.md).

Instead, use configuration and customize it with modules, plugins or extensions and make those available to the community.
See [Standard for Publishing Open Source Code](publishing-open-source-code.md).

To make changes in open source software, engage with the community and submit changes upstream to ensure that they are supported by future updates.

It's easy to copy (fork) open source software and start making changes to the source code.
If a fork is created, be aware it can make future updates and security patches hard to implement as well as trigger additional licence obligations.
The development team that made the changes will be responsible for maintaining those changes unless they are contributed to the upstream version.
