# Guides for open standards

The [Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), Appendix C provides mandatory procedures for enterprise architecture assessment that will be used by departmental Architecture Review Boards (ARB) and the Government of Canada Enterprise ARB as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

These align with the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and the procedures for Application Architecture provide that, where possible, you must use open standards and open source software first.
Open standards ensure your system works and communicates with other products or systems, and can easily be upgraded and expanded.

Adopting and using open standards means you can:

* move between different technologies when you need to, avoiding lock-in
* quickly and easily change your service when you need to
* increase compatibility with all stakeholders
* open up the range of companies you can purchase from as more of them are likely to use the same standard as you
* access a wider range of both open source and proprietary software vendors
