# Guide for open standards (Draft)

The [Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), Appendix C provides mandatory procedures for enterprise architecture assessment that will be used by departmental Architecture Review Boards (ARB) and the Government of Canada Enterprise ARB as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

These align with the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and the [Procedures for Application Architecture](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249#claC.2.3.8) provide that, where possible, you must use open standards first.

> **[Per Mandatory Procedures for Enterprise Architecture Assessment (C2.3.8)](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249&section=procedure&p=C), Open standards designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) must be used.**
> **All open standards must be selected first on the basis of their additional inherent flexibility and interoperability benefits.**
> **All new purchases, upgrades or migrations must store and manage data using open standards.**

The steps for GC to use open standards are:

1. Use open standards designated by TBS
1. Find other open standards
1. Propose open standards that should be designated by TBS
1. Other Notes
