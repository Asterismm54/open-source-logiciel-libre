# Guides for contributing to open source software

## Respect

Although technical in nature, the open source software community is first and foremost about people. Treat other people with respect. Be kind, be open, respect the culture of the community you are interacting with and be aware of the diversity of people in that community. Be aware that, particularly in electronic communication, you might misunderstand or misinterpret what others are saying or meaning. The reverse is also true.

Follow any codes of conduct and set a high bar for your own behaviour.
