# Guides for contributing to open source software

The [Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), Appendix C provides mandatory procedures for enterprise architecture assessment that will be used by departmental Architecture Review Boards (ARB) and the Government of Canada Enterprise ARB as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

These align with the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and the procedures for Application Architecture provide that, all source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license when appropriate.
