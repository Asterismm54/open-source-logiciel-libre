# Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software (Draft)

The [Directive on Management of Information Technology](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=15249), Appendix C provides mandatory procedures for enterprise architecture assessment that will be used by departmental Architecture Review Boards (ARB) and the Government of Canada Enterprise ARB as an assessment framework to review digital initiatives to ensure the GC acts as a single enterprise and to ensure departmental alignment with the GC digital direction.

These align with the [Digital Standards](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/modernizing/government-canada-digital-standards.html) and the procedures for Application Architecture provide that, all source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license when appropriate. This includes contributing code to existing open source software projects.

> **All source code modifications made to existing open source software, whether in-house by GC or through procurement contracts, must be shared back with the open source software community.**
> **Support and be an active contributor, by sharing code, by creating bug reports and feature requests as helping with testing and influencing the development roadmap, to open source software used by the GC or where there is benefit to Canadians.**

The steps to GC employees contributing to open source software communities are:


1. [Verify Open Source Software Licence](#verify-open-source-software-licence)
1. [Verify Contributing Process and Policies](#verify-contributing-process-and-policies)
1. [Seek Approvals](#seek-approvals)
1. [Contribute](#contribute)
1. [Other Notes](#other-notes)

## Verify Open Source Software Licence

GC can contribute to all software licensed under an [Open Source Initiative approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) or a [Free Software Foundation free software licence](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html).

## Verify Contributing Process and Policies

**note:** CLA, DCO, ..

## Seek Approvals

### Time

GC Employees must get their manager's approval to spend time contributing to open source software.

### Department

Similar to open data or information covered by the [Directive on Open Government](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108), the publication of source code under an open source software licence, requires appropriate department or agency approvals.
Because of the required assignment of rights by an open source software licence, the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM), or any other person named by the ADM is responsible for approving the releases of open source code.

## Contribute to the project

### Identify as an employee of the Government of Canada

Employees must use their full name and Government of Canada email address for all code contributions to public repositories while acting within the scope of their duties or employment.

### Submit changes

To make changes in open source software, engage with the community and submit your changes upstream to ensure that your modifications are supported by future updates.

**note:** More than code (Bug reports, feature requests, direction, security assessments, ..)

## Contribute through professional services

If professional services are used to contribute to third party projects, see [Guide for publishing Open Source Code](publishing-open-source-code.md#obtain-rights-to-custom-code-in-contracts)

## Other Notes

* Licence delegation authority (IP+licence)
* Type of contribution allowed (_code_, bugs, issues, etc.)
* Security
* Basic commits guidelines (use your name, prof email address., message, etc.)
* Grants and contributions: bug bounties via GCDevExchange?
