# Guides for Publishing Open Source Code

## Approvals

Similar to open data or information covered by the Open Government Directive, the release of open source code under open source software (OSS) licences, requires appropriate department or agency approvals.
Currently this is assumed to be the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM), or any other person named by the ADM, and the Information Management Senior Official (IMSO) of departments and agencies.

## Intellectual Property

### Copyright

The [Copyright Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/index.html) provides that where any work is, or has been, prepared or published by or under the direction or control of Her Majesty or any government department, the copyright in the work shall, subject to any agreement with the author, belong to Her Majesty (Section 12).  This applies to source code.

However, Government of Canada employees have moral rights in the works they create, unless they choose to waive these rights (Section 14.1).

Use your Government of Canada email address for contributions.

#### Appropriate Government of Canada Copyright Identification

© Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of (legal departmental name), (year of publication).

### Licencing

The owner of the copyright in any work may assign the right and may grant any interest in the right by licence, but no assignment or grant is valid unless it is in writing signed by the owner of the right in respect of which the assignment or grant is made, or by the owner’s duly authorized agent (Section 13).

#### Choosing an open source software licence

When the project is part of a larger Open Source ecosystem, use the license which is usually used in this ecosystem.
Otherwise choose a license which matches the goal of the project and its interactions with other projects.
Choosing an appropriate licence tends to revolve around the decision of whether to apply a permissive or reciprocal licence.

##### Permissive licences

* Maximize the scope of downstream users
* Broad appeal to the entire private sector

Recommended permissive licences for Government of Canada open source code are MIT and Apache 2.0.

##### Reciprocal licences

* Appropriate in cases where it is important to receive back downstream changes, or where it is important to ensure that work built on an initial investment remains free and open source software.
* Can also put a focus on benefiting other private-sector businesses that provide services and support.

Recommended reciprocal licences for Government of Canada open source code are GPL 3.0, LGPL 3.0 and AGPL 3.0.

## Public source code repositories

Recommended source code repositories for Government of Canada open source code are:

* [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Framagit](https://framagit.org/)
* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
* [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)

## Mandatory files

Before publishing your source code, it must include a LICENCE (see Licencing above), a README.md and a CONTRIBUTING.md explaining the project and how to contribute. You can find examples of these files in the [Template repository](https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/template-gabarit).

## Contributor License Agreement

Government of Canada projects dont use contributor agreements, but rely on the open source software licenses providing the necessary terms.
This means that contributions are made under the same license under which the project is released.

## Respect

Although technical in nature, the open source software community is first and foremost about people. Treat other people with respect. Be kind, be open, respect the culture of the community you are interacting with and be aware of the diversity of people in that community. Be aware that, particularly in electronic communication, you might misunderstand or misinterpret what others are saying or meaning. The reverse is also true.

Follow any codes of conduct and set a high bar for your own behaviour.

## Open Resource Exchange

Add a link to your source code repository on the [Open Source Code section on the Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/open-source-code.html).

Instructions for how to updated the data can be found on [Github](https://github.com/canada-ca/ore-ero/tree/master/_data).
