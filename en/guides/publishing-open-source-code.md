# Guides for publishing open source code

## Approvals

Similar to open data or information covered by the Open Government Directive, the release of open source code under open source software (OSS) licences, requires appropriate department or agency approvals.
Currently this is assumed to be the Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM), or any other person named by the ADM, and the Information Management Senior Official (IMSO) of departments and agencies.
