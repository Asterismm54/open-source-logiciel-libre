# Guides for Using Open Source Software

## Approvals

## Licenses

All code licensed under an Open Source Initiative approved license can generally be used. Be careful when combining code with different licenses. Certain licenses are incompatible when combined in the same program. Consult with you legal team if you are not sure.

## Open Resource Exchange

Add open source software your department or agency is using to the [Open Source Software section on the Open Resource Exchange](https://canada-ca.github.io/ore-ero/open-source-software.html).
