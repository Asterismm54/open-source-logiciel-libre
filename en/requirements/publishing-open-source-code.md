[Back to Table of Contents](../../README.md#english-content)

## Objectives and expected results

The objective of this directive is to maximize the release of source code, whether developed in-house by departments and agencies or through negotiated contracts, to support transparency, accountability, citizen engagement, and socio-economic benefits through reuse, subject to applicable restrictions associated with privacy, confidentiality, and security.

### The expected results of this directive are as follows

* Canadians are able to find, reuse and contribute to GC software projects and source code to support meaningful engagement with their government.
* Support and increase collaboration between departments, agencies and other public administrations in Canada and around the world, including society as a whole.
* Improve the overall availability and quality of re-usable technology within government and society.

## Requirements

Ensuring that Government of Canada source code, whether developed in-house by departments and agencies or through negotiated contracts, is released under an appropriate open source software licence.

Ensuring that the Government of Canada source code is released using an open and accessible version control system via a public source code repository.

### Exceptions to publications

* Code that is being tested, experimented with and is disposable.
* Code deemed of National security value.
* Code related to unreleased policy or law.

Such exceptions will require:

* Explaining and documenting why a project is not released as open source.
* Making the source code internally available to the Government as a whole where possible.
