* Increase the reuse of existing open source software and technology by departments and agencies.
* Support and increase collaboration between departments, agencies and other public administrations in Canada and around the world, including society as a whole.
* Canadians are able to reuse and contribute to open source software used by the GC to support meaningful engagement with their government and communities.
* Improve the overall availability of re-usable technology within government and society.
* Support Canadian economic growth by removing barriers to entry in providing technological services and solutions.
